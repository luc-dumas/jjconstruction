## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

 For this client, I built a website for his small business that includes flexbox and grid layouts and was designed for responsive window sizing. Additionally, I utilized scripting and animation using JS and JQuery to animate mouse hover and click
events.



## Lessons Learned:

This project was a great lesson in learning how to design with CSS as well as in learning how to communicate with a client.
